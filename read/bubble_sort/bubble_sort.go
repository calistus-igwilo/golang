/* 
Write a Bubble Sort program in Go. The program should prompt the user 
to type in a sequence of up to 10 integers. The program should print 
the integers out on one line, in sorted order, from least to greatest. 

As part of this program, you should write a function called BubbleSort() 
which takes a slice of integers as an argument and returns nothing. 
The BubbleSort() function should modify the slice so that the elements 
are in sorted order.

A recurring operation in the bubble sort algorithm is the Swap operation 
which swaps the position of two adjacent elements in the slice. You 
should write a Swap() function which performs this operation. Your 
Swap() function should take two arguments, a slice of integers and 
an index value i which indicates a position in the slice. The Swap() 
function should return nothing, but it should swap the contents of 
the slice in position i with the contents in position i+1.
